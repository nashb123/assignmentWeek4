        <H2>Welcome to the Mojave Wildflower Society!</H2>
        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>We're a small community of plant-lovers dedicated to learning about, celebrating, and conserving the many unique and beautiful native plants and wildflowers found in the Mojave Desert. Made up of volunteer scientists, teachers, students, and members of the Mojave community, we welcome everyone to join our plant posse.</p>
        <p>For generations, our mission has been to educate and learn, conserve, and train the next generation of our community to be stewards of this rich and diverse ecosystem. The Mojave Desert is not just home to thousands of plant species but is also to hundreds of endemic animal species and indigenous communities.</p>
        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>We focus on educational experiences aimed at our youngest desert-dwellers, but folks of all ages are welcome to our events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plant identification lessons</li>
                <li>Conservation workshops</li>
                <li>Beginner hikes</li>
                <li>Community cleanup events</li>
                <li>Hands-on activities, like planting native seeds and creating pollinator-friendly gardens</li>
